  <h2>How does the spreadsheet below work?</h2>
  <p> The spreadsheet works as a typical Google spreadsheet. Within this spreadsheet, anyone with a surplus amount of food
  can post what food they have, how much of it they have, and when it will go bad (look at the Ways to help page for more 
  information on expirations. Any organization or individual looking for food, will be able to “post” items they have need 
  for, <em>or</em> claim items posted by other users. Whether you are giving or receiving food, please post your email or phone
  number so that people can contact you as to where and how to transfer the food.  </p>
