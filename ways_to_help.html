    <h2>How can you make a difference?</h2>
    <ul> 
        <li>Buy and eat fruits that are considered “ugly” so they are not thrown away by the retail stores.</li>
        <li>Use your common sense instead of the expiration date becasue there are many differenct kinds of expiration dates
        that are way too confusing to understand.</li>
        <li>Store food correctly so that it doesn't spoil. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/cook

        <h3> Don't Donnate Canned Food </h3>

        <p>
          What to donate: The best thing to donate to a food bank is money. No one really eats canned goods and they contain
          high amounts of sodium. Because food banks buy things at a wholesale level and have partnerships with farmers, they 
          can buy a lot more food, with a lot less money. So with the dollar you spend on the can of beans,a food bank could 
          have bought tons of fresh food that people will actually enjoy eating.
