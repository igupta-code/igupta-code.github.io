        <h2> How much do we waste?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>40% of the food we are supposed to be eating is wasted</li>
            <li>1.3 billion tonnes of food goes in the trash</li>
            <li>20 billion pounds is wasted on farms every year</li>
            <li>The worldâ€™s one billion hungry people could be fed on less than a quarter o food waste from
                the US, UK and Europe.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2> Why is food waste a problem?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>$220 billion growing, transporting, and processing food that is wasted</li>
            <li>Food waste costs $162 billion a year</li>
            <li>Food waste in landfills create methane, a poisonous greenhouse gas.</li>    
            <li>Globally, methane gas from food waste makes up seven percent of total greenhouse emissions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Where and how do we manage to waste so much food? <h2>
            <p> Food waste occurs at every one of the four steps of the food industry. <br>
                <strong>Production:</strong> Because of pest infections and severe weather, plants die before they can even be harvested.<br>
                <strong>Food processing:</strong> In storage, food is wasted because of pests. Especially in areas where it is hot or very 
                humid. <br>
                <strong>Retail:</strong> The Natural Resources Defense Council did reaserch proving that the leading cause of food waste in 
                America, was confusing expiration dates, such as best before, sell-by, or use-by dates. Retail stores throw away 
                large amounts of food because of these confusions. If produce is misshapen, brused, or abnormal, they are thrown
                away even though they are completely edible. On top of this, <strong>2.3 million tonnes</strong> of fish are discarded in the North
                Atlantic and Noth Sea every year because they are the wrong species or even just the wrong size. <br>
